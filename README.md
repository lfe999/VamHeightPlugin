# Height Measurement Virt-A-Mate Plugin 

Measures proportions of the Virt-A-Mate character.

## Installing

Requires VaM 1.19 or newer.

Download `LFE.HeightMeasure.(version).var` from [Releases](https://github.com/lfe999/VamHeightPlugin/releases)

Save the `.var` file in the `(VAM_ROOT)\AddonPackages`.

## Quickstart

Add this plugin to the Virt-A-Mate character that you would like to have measured.

Make sure to reset the pose to a T-pose under Person > Control & Physics 1 > Reset Pose

As you change the character scale and morphs, the updated measurements should calculate.
